# generate more granular ratings (3 decimal points eg 0.456, 1.234 etc) these number will get added through the play resolution process in the main game and eventually we round off the runs anyway but granularity differentiates players more than the coarse ratings (qv the fictional generator for specific code)
# need to build in era/year adjustments - might be good to have a separate file with yearly calculation distributions for average, power, etc (there is a historical wOBA list on fangraphs)
# stadium value should be broken down into batting and pitching values (MLB only)
# incorporate injury data from fangraphs (at least for the 2023 sheet)
# need to change 'B' to 'S' in database for switch hitters
# do i need yearly stats to normalise ratings?
# usage penalties? does need to be set elsewhere in the game? also for splits, penalties or bonuses should be capped at certain amounts depending on ABs vs L or R. ie if you batted 3 for 7 that year against L, you wouldnt get a 3. you would need to exceed an AB threshold to get higher than 1, then another for 2, same for negative

# 1980s db: splits for pitchers and batters
1) when i finish with rosters, i will need to account for the fact that w the fangraphs data, i have no split seasons for players - its just one entry. and baseball-ref rosters may have duplicates (ie same player on multiple teams)


need to redo team_x_hr chart to look like this:
    "X-HR_chart": {
      "3": 122,
      "2": 145,
      "1": 323,

its broken right now
