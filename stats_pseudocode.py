'''
1. Update Stats and Write Back to JSON:
You can integrate the updated stats into your existing team JSON files. When each game is played, you'll update the PitcherStats or BatterStats object and then write these updated stats back into the corresponding team's JSON file.

2. Modifying Your Team Object:
You can modify your Team class to have methods that not only update the statistics of the players but also save the team data (including updated stats) back to the JSON file.

3. Extend the Save Team Data Logic:
You already have a save_team_data method (or similar) in your main loop. This method should be responsible for writing updated team stats back to the JSON file after each game.

Once your Team object updates the player stats after each game (in the play_game function), you can call save_team_data to save the updated data back into the corresponding JSON file. For example, in your main loop:
'''

# Play the game
result = game.play_game(day)

# Update team stats
team_stats_lookup[home_team_id].update_stats(result['home_runs'], result['away_runs'])
team_stats_lookup[away_team_id].update_stats(result['away_runs'], result['home_runs'])

# Save updated team data (including stats)
home_team.save_team_data()
away_team.save_team_data()

'''
If you want to separate stats from the team JSON file, you can create a dedicated file for stats. For example, each team could have a team_id_{id}_stats.json file that only contains the stats. This file would be loaded and saved similarly to how you handle the team file.
